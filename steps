TASK ONE: DEPLOYING A WEB APPLICATION ON AWS
  STEP ONE: Logging in to AWS console.
  STEP TWO: 
    •	Here I chose " Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (HVM), EBS General Purpose (SSD) Volume Type " as AMI.
    •	The instance type is “t2.micro”.
    •	Configure the Instance Details. You can use the default settings.
    •	Add Storage. The default 8 GB should be enough for a simple web application.
    •	Adding Tags is optional.
    •	Configuring the Security Group is very essential. Create a new security group that allows HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) traffic.
    •	I have used an existing keypair. This key pair is used to access your instance via SSH.
    •	After these steps we can launch the instance.
 STEP THREE:
    •	This step involves connecting the EC2 instance.
 STEP FOUR:
 This step involves installing the webserver into it. We use the following commands – 
    •	sudo apt update
    •	sudo apt install apache2
    •	sudo systemctl start apache2
    •	sudo systemctl enable apache2
    •	sudo systemctl status apache2
 STEP FIVE:
 This step invloves deploying web application.
    •	We’ll go into /var/www/html
    •	For this we use cd /var/www/html
    •	Then we use index.html file present there.
    •	The code for the index.html file is mentioned in separate file.
    •	Open a web browser and enter the public IP address of your EC2 instance top access the web application. 
 STEP SIX: 
 Configure Security Groups (if needed)
    •	Open Additional Ports (if your application requires other ports, like HTTPS):
    •	Go to the EC2 Dashboard, select your instance, and click "Security Groups" in the Description tab.
    •	Edit the inbound rules to add any additional ports required.
